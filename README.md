# Darkbox-Camera
A script to control RPi to capture time lapse of dark box conditions and use IR lights to illuminate the subjects.

## What it does
The program runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer.
It allows the operator to control the camera and take a sequence of pictures with a chosen interval of time between each photograph, and ensures that the scene is illuminated by an infra-red LED when the photograph is to be taken, leaving the interior of the system in darkness otherwise.
The intended use of the program is with a containment made to keep out ambient light that only the IR light, camera, and subject are allowed into, with the circuitry and computer used for control of the system exterior to the dark box conditions.

## Why it is useful
The program and associated system allows a timelapse of the subject to be taken in dark conditions for minimal cost and requiring no researcher intervention, only setup.
